### CHALLENGES ###
1. hosted on local machine so ip address will always be the same
  - resolved by generating fake ip address and storing in cookie for that visitor
2. mail program: mailgun unavailable (now paid) so used sendinblue
3. bootstrap: great to start with, but very hard to customize. Ended up using the col-system from it for formatting and a few other things but mainly sass
4. selection ranking: generated selections, allow movement of selections and also when submitting them assign a value based on position of submission
